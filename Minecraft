# Minecraft
Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and developed by Mojang Studios and was released in November 2011. Minecraft is available in many platforms, namely on mobile devices such as phones or tablets,  controllers such as xbox or Playstation and computers such as laptops or PCs. Minecraft is a rather popular game with many players worldwide.
The aim of this game is that there is no aim. You can play in Survival Mode, which allows you to finish the game by beating The End by slaying the Ender Dragon. Even then, you are free to build, construct, beautify, in any means possible. As Minecraft describes, there are infinite wonders, infinite possibilities.
In addition, many players battle each other in servers, mainly pvp games such as BedWars, Hunger Games or building and survival games such as Skyblock.
